# micrograd

![awww](puppy.jpg)

A tiny Autograd engine (with a bite! :)). Implements backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) over a dynamically built DAG and a small neural networks library on top of it with a PyTorch-like API. Both are tiny, with about 100 and 50 lines of code respectively.

The DAG only allows operates over scalar values, so e.g. we chop up each neuron into all of its individual tiny adds and multiplies. However, this is enough to build up entire deep neural nets doing binary classification, as the demo notebook shows. Potentially useful for educational purposes. See the notebook `demo.ipynb` for a full demo of training an MLP binary classifier.

### Example usage

Just a slightly contrived example showing a number of possible operations:

```python
from micrograd.engine import Value

a = Value(-4.0)
b = Value(2.0)
c = a + b
d = a * b + b**3
c += c + 1
c += 1 + c + (-a)
d += d * 2 + (b + a).relu()
d += 3 * d + (b - a).relu()
e = c - d
f = e**2
g = f / 2.0
g += 10.0 / f
print(f'{g.data:.4f}') # prints 24.7041, the outcome of this forward pass
g.backward()
print(f'{a.grad:.4f}') # prints 138.8338, i.e. the numerical value of dg/da
print(f'{b.grad:.4f}') # prints 645.5773, i.e. the numerical value of dg/db
```

### Tracing / visualization

Have a look at the jupyter notebook `trace_graph.ipynb` to also produce graphviz visualizations. E.g. this one is of a simple 2D neuron, arrived at by calling `draw_dot` on the code below, and it shows both the data (top number in each node) and the gradient (bottom number in each node).

```python
from micrograd import nn
n = nn.Neuron(2)
x = [Value(1.0), Value(-2.0)]
y = n(x)
dot = draw_dot(y)
```
